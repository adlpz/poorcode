<p>There we go again. It's the 5th of December, 00:19 in the clock. End of 2019. Almost 2020. That's <em>twenty years</em> after Y2K. I mean, to be honest, what could be a better time to...</p>
<p>...start a blog??</p>
<p>So here's the general rules about this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I won't keep a schedule</li>
<li>It won't be read by anyone</li>
<li>Because I'll most likely never write anything</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what's the point? Having a place where to dump by brain farts in an orderly manner. That's it. And yeah a place where I can point people to if my brain farts are worthy.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say. Another &quot;first post&quot; post. I've made so many of those that I've lost count. Let's see what happens.</p>
