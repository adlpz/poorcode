There we go again. It's the 5th of December, 00:19 in the clock. End of 2019. Almost 2020. That's *twenty years* after Y2K. I mean, to be honest, what could be a better time to...


...start a blog??

So here's the general rules about this blog:

- I won't keep a schedule
- It won't be read by anyone
- Because I'll most likely never write anything


So, what's the point? Having a place where to dump by brain farts in an orderly manner. That's it. And yeah a place where I can point people to if my brain farts are worthy.

That's all I have to say. Another "first post" post. I've made so many of those that I've lost count. Let's see what happens.
