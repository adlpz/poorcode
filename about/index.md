Hi. I'm Adri√†. In short:

- I work in tech as the CTO of [YDEVS](https://ydevs.com), a dev, web and marketing shop in Valencia, Spain (that's [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Valencia/@45.3359257,3.7640699,4945958m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xd604f4cf0efb06f:0xb4a351011f7f1d39!2sValencia!3b1!8m2!3d39.4699075!4d-0.3762881!3m4!1s0xd604f4cf0efb06f:0xb4a351011f7f1d39!8m2!3d39.4699075!4d-0.3762881?hl=en))
- I write sometimes here. Mostly about tech, sometimes politics or things I find intersting.
